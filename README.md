# datalogger-
Arduino based data logger which can log temperature, humidity, time and other parameters in a SD card.
The saved data should be opened in an excel file. For reading the temperature and humidity data from atmosphere we are using a DHT11 sensor along with the arduino board.
Connections between arduino board, DHT11 sensor and SD card are shown in the below diagram, which is taken from <a href="https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/arduino-data-logger-project">here</a>.
